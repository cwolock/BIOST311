# Instructions

Statistical Analysis Plans (SAPs) are an integral part of any statistical analysis. Using this document as a guide, you will outline the statistical analyses you plan to run and any output that you plan to create. SAPs are especially important for reproducibility of your results---the goal is that anyone should be able to exactly re-create your analysis after reading your SAP.

This assignment is limited to **three pages (including your variables table and example figure)**, and your written text should use at least 12-point font. See the template below for a list of components that need to be included in your final *Statistical Analysis Plan.* You plan should be submitted as a .pdf file---whether you choose to use RMarkdown, Microsoft Word, or other software is up to you. (*Do not include the instructions or rubric in your report.*) 

Submit your SAP on Canvas by 11:59pm on May 6. **Do not discuss your project with other students or post questions about your project on the Canvas discussion board.** But, feel free to ask the instructors any questions in person/via Canvas message instead!

This assignment is graded and is worth 5% of your overall course grade.

# Template and Rubric

## Formatting (0.5 points)

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should...

- use 12 point font
- write no more than three pages (including your variables table and example figure)

## Title (0.5 points)

*Make up a title for your proposed study.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, your title should...

- be informative (e.g., allude to your scientific goal)
- not contain any abbreviations

NOTE: You can re-use what you wrote for your *Project Proposal,* but make sure to address any of the comments we gave you. 


## Background and Introduction (3 points)

*Provide a brief description of your data to give perspective into the importance of the problem and the situation under study. In particular, why were the data collected?*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, your background/introduction should include...

- 1-2 paragraphs of scientific background
    - Set the stage for why this is an interesting overall scientific question to study
    - Why is this an important/relevant outcome to look at?
    - Why is this an important/relevant predictor/exposure to look at?
    - What other variables might be related to your outcome and/or predictor?
- (Brief, 1 paragraph) description of study/data
    - Who (is being studied)? 
    - Where (was the study conducted/are your subjects from)? 
    - When (was the data collected)?
    - Where did you get your data (provide enough detail that someone else could go out and find it)

NOTE: You can re-use what you wrote for your *Project Proposal,* but make sure to address any of the comments we gave you. You may need to add additional detail to address the criteria above. Do your best to locate the above information about your dataset. If you truly cannot answer some of the questions, acknowledge this in your writeup. 


## Scientific Questions (3 points)

*In this section, you should lay out the scientific agenda of your analysis. In particular, you should state both the overall scientific goal and the specific scientific objectives.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- your overall scientific goal
- at least two specific scientific questions (note that this is different than statistical questions!)

NOTE: You can re-use what you wrote for your *Project Proposal,* but make sure to address any of the comments we gave you.


## Study Design (3 points)

*How were the data collected? How many subjects are in the study? Include all necessary information for interpreting your analysis.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- who is being studied
- what type of study is this (observational vs experimental; if observational, what type)
- where was this study conducted, where are the subjects from
- when was this study conducted
- how were data collected

NOTE: You will discuss *what* was collected in the "Variables" section. Do your best to locate the above information about your dataset. If you truly cannot answer some of the questions, acknowledge this in your writeup. 


## Statistical Questions (3 points)

*Connect the scientific questions listed above with statistical hypotheses that you can test using your statistical tools. Make sure to list all variables that you will use in each analysis.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should take each of your (2+) specific scientific questions and re-phrase them as a "statistical question" here. In particular, your statistical question should be a more precise version of your scientific question, which specifies:

- what is the outcome variable
- what is the predictor of interest
- what other variables will you adjust for


## Variables (3 points)

*Create a table listing EVERY variable you plan on including in your analysis and provides its name, brief description, classification according to type (e.g., quantitative, categorical, binary), units of measurement, scientific meaning (see below), and role in the analysis (see below). If you are going to create any new variables (e.g., by re-coding a continuous quantitative variable as binary), please include the new variable in this table as well.*

*Examples of scientific meaning:*

- demographic (e.g., age, sex)
- baseline physiology (e.g., systolic blood pressure)
- baseline disease risk factors
- measures of treatment intervention (in an experiment) or exposure (in an observational study)
- measures of treatment outcome (in an experiment) or exposure effect (in an observational study)

*Examples of role in analysis (note: variables could have more than one, if used in more than one analysis):*

- response (outcome)
- predictor(s) of interest
- variables identifying subgroups to explore (effect modifiers)
- potential confounders
- potential precision variables
- surrogates for the response
- variables that are a result of the predictor of interest

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should...

- list every variable relevant to your analysis
- provide all pieces of information mentioned above: name, description, type, units, scientific meaning, role in analysis
- organize this information into a table

## Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Analysis Planning (3 points)

*Describe the descriptive statistics you will compute, how you will compute them, and how you will display your results (figures, tables). Generally, descriptive statistics are used to evaluate and compare subgroups, identify errors in the data, and identify patterns of missing data. Often, these descriptive analyses will support the inferential analyses you report.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- description of what numerical summaries you will calculate (e.g., mean, standard deviation, proportion, number of missing) for what variables, and within which subgroups (if applicable)
- description of any tables and figures

### Descriptive Analysis Example (3 points)

*Make one (1) of the descriptive plots you outlined in the previous section, to get a feel for working with your dataset.*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- one descriptive plot with title, axis labels, caption, legend, etc. 

### Inferential Analysis Planning (3 points)

*For each inferential analysis (e.g. regression) you plan on running, describe the variables you will include, types of estimates and uncertainty quantification you will report, and hypothesis tests you will run. Be specific! Details like confidence level are important!*

To receive full credit for this portion of the assignment, you should include...

- for each model: what is your outcome, what is your predictor of interest, what variables are you adjusting for
- what numbers will you report/interpret; if this includes a p-value, what are your null and alternative hypotheses and what p-value threshold will you use for calling something "statistically significant"
