\begin{frame}{Class communication}
We will communicate with you outside of class using the Canvas page, so please sign up to receive email notifications for the page. \\~\

Questions about course context or homework assignments should be posted to the Canvas Discussion Board, \textbf{not sent via email}. We will monitor the discussion board regularly, and also strongly encourage you to reply to each otherâ€™s questions. Concerns of a personal nature can be communicated with us via email, and in general any emails should be sent to both instructors. \\~\

Please communicate respectfully to your classmates and to us, and let us know if there are ways classroom communication can be made more accessible to you. \\~\

Instructors will not send same-day responses to messages sent after 8:00pm PST.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Homework}

Homework assignments will be posted on the Canvas website one week 
prior to the due date. They should be completed in a Word or .pdf document and 
submitted electronically to the Canvas website by the due date. You are welcome to work together on homework; however, your submitted assignment (including R code, if applicable) should be in your own words. \\~\

Solution keys and individual feedback will be provided. \textcolor{red}{We have prepared a guide for how to present your assignments which is available on our Canvas page.} The lowest homework score will be dropped.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Homework: Late policy}
Throughout the quarter, you may use up to three homework 
extension days. These three days may be divided up for homework assignments however you choose (for example: all three days for a single assignment, one day each for three separate assignments). \\~\

In order to use your extension days, \textbf{you must email both instructors prior to the homework due date} to inform them you plan to use an extension day. If you do not email the instructors prior to homework due date, the extension days will not be counted, and your homework will be counted as late. \\~\

Late homework receives no credit.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quizzes}
There will be weekly, open-note Canvas quizzes on Mondays. These quizzes are designed to ensure that you keep up with course material and can recall material from previous weeks. Each quiz will consist of 10 questions, 3 of which will be on information from previous weeks, and 7 of which will be on material from the most recent week of lectures. Questions will be a mix of multiple choice, True/False, and open response. \\~\

Quizzes will be graded Monday evening, and you will have 48 hours from Monday 11:59pm PST to Wednesday 11:59pm PST to complete quiz revisions, for the opportunity to earn back up to 50\% of the points you missed.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Discussion section}
Discussion sections will consist of \textcolor{red}{group activities}, review of class material, discussion of group projects, and practice using R. You will be required to hand in a brief exercise (credit/no credit) at each discussion section. Your discussion section score will be based on completion of these assignments. To receive full credit for discussion section, you can miss at most one of the discussions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Final Project}
There will be a final data analysis project for which you will be given a dataset (or select your own, with approval from the instructors) and asked to develop a appropriate analysis plan, carry out the analysis, and write a short report. Projects will be introduced in the first discussion section. \textcolor{red}{You will complete your project in small groups, assigned by the instructors.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course policies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Laptops}: You will be expected to have access to a laptop during discussion sections. However, you will not generally need access to a computer during lecture (different if zoom, obviously).
	\item \textbf{Computing}: Computing in R is an important component of this course. FIND OUT WHERE THEY CAN BORROW COMPUTERS and include here. Please see us if this expectation will cause trouble for you, and we can work out a solution.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course policies (continued)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Collaboration}: You are encouraged to work together on homework assignments, but the final write-up should be done individually. The course project will be a \textcolor{red}{group project}; you will discuss approaches to the project with your group and other classmates during discussion sections, but outside of class you may only discuss your project with your group members and the instructors.
	\item \textbf{Academic Honesty}: Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the academic honesty policies. If you hand in work that is not written in your own words, you will at minimum lose all credit for the problem, and at maximum all credit for the assignment. Issues surrounding academic integrity will be handled in accordance with university policies.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course policies (continued)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Grading}: We will have assignments graded in a timely fashion. If you have questions or concerns about the grading, see us. We reserve the right to change or not change the grade.

\begin{frame}[c]
\centering \huge Any Questions?
\end{frame}

\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}{Why is statistics important?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We have a research question we want to answer
	\item We hear a claim we think is false, and want to refute it
	\item We have a \textit{ton} of information and we don't know how to make sense of it
	\item We understand the current state of things, but want to predict future outcomes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Research question}

Retinol (a Vitamin A derivative) is a popular skin care agent that has been shown in studies to decrease wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation. However, retinol is not safe to use for pregant individuals, and additionally retinol has known side-effects of causing skin dryness and stinging for many people. Bakuchiol has been proposed as a retinol alternative that is safe for pregnant individuals to use and does not have similar negative side-effects. However, we are not sure if Bakuchiol is \textit{as effective} as retinol for decreasing wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation. 

\vspace{0.3cm}

Q: \textit{Is Bakuchiol as effective as retinol for improving wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation?} 

\vspace{0.3cm}

How do we answer this question? (one option: \href{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.16918}{a randomized trial})

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Research question}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Randomly assign 44 individuals to either use Bakuchiol or Retinol over the course of 12 weeks, surveying individuals and taking images every 4 weeks 
	\item Use image analysis to determine fine wrinkle surface area at each time point
\end{itemize}

\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{retinol.png}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Research question}

Why is statistics important?

\vspace{0.3cm}

In this example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows us to determine whether or not there is a difference in outcomes based on exposure (retinol vs. Bakuchiol) that is due to \textit{the exposure alone} (i.e. no other variable could have mattered)
	\item A standardized way of measuring the outcome. This study didn't compare qualitatively if they thought individuals had a lower wrinkle surface area, they used image analysis!
	\item Allows us to determine if there is a \textit{statistically significant} difference in outcomes between Bakuchiol and retinol users (we'll come back to this throughout the course)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Example: Refuting a false claim}
\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{lancet.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Refuting a false claim}
A paper published in the Lacet (a relatively high-impact journal!) in 1998 suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may cause autism spectrum disorder in children.

\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{mmrvax.jpg}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Refuting a false claim}

Statistical tools used to critically assess (and eventually refute) this claim:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sample size in their study was $n = 12$ (which is \textit{very} small)
	\item Their study design was uncontrolled, so causal claims could not be made (more on this to follow in the Study Design review section!)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}

Why is statistics important?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows us to critically assess scientific claims
	\item Understanding the assumptions underlying statistical methods and study designs lets us think \textit{scientifically and statistically} about whether or not these assumptions are met
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\footnotesize An important aside with this study is that the lead author was funded by lawyers who had been representing parents in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies. Critically reading studies from \textit{many} angles (not only statistical) is important! A more detailed summary of this article and follow-up can be found \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/}{\color{cyan} here}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: How do we make sense of data?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cholera outbreak in 1854 in London
	\item People were unsure where it was coming from (airborne? spread through food? from animals?)
	\item Informational available: where cholera patients lived
	\item John Snow (below) decided to make a map...
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Example: How do we make sense of data?}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Mapping the cholera cases was the key to realizing the disease was spread through water, specifically the Broad Street pump
	\item An example of descriptive spatial statistics
\end{itemize}

Why is statistics important?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows us to distinguish patterns in data that were previously unclear
	\item With this specific example, more advanced statistical methods could be used to detect clusters of points in space

\begin{frame}{Example: Prediction}
Why is statistics important?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Statistics influences public policy and our daily lives
	\item Care needs to be taken when developing prediction models
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Which covariates may be important predictors of the outcome?
		\item Which covariates are extraneous and don't need to be included?
		\item Are any of the covariates we include \textit{problematic}, or may lead to conclusions that are socially unjust?
		\item What social (political) context do we need to be considering when making a prediction model?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Uncertainty needs to be appropriately calculated \textit{and} reported
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Takeaway}
Regression (the main focus of our course) is a statistical tool underlying \textit{many} statistical problems, including some of the ones we just discussed.
\end{frame}

\section{Study Design}

\begin{frame}{Study Design}
\textit{How you collect data impacts what questions you can (cannot) answer, what statistical methods you can (cannot) use, and what conclusions you can (cannot) draw.} \\~\

\textcolor{blue}{Extreme Example:} Suppose I'm interested in understanding public opinion about biostatistics. I randomly select on individual from our class and ask if they like biostatistics.

\begin{itemize}
	\item What questions can I answer using these data?
	\item What statistical methods can I use to analyze these data?
	\item What conclusions can I draw using these data?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Experimental vs. Observational Studies}

\textcolor{blue}{Experimental:} exposure/treatment is \textit{controlled} by the researcher (e.g., randomly assign people to drug or placebo)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Randomized controlled trial 
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textcolor{blue}{Observational:} exposure/treatment is \textit{not controlled} by the researcher (e.g., we look at a group of people and \textit{observe} who smokes and who doesn't smoke)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cross-sectional study
	\item Cohort study
	\item Case-control study
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
	
	
\begin{frame}{Experimental vs. Observational Studies}
In \textit{experimental} studies, we can talk about \color{blue} \textit{causation}\color{black}. In \textit{observational} studies we  talk instead about \color{blue} \textit{association} \color{black}(because we worry about \color{blue} \textit{confounding}\color{black}). \\

\vspace{0.3cm}

% we'll come back to this when we talk about interpreting results
A \textit{\textcolor{blue}{confounder}} is a variable that is \textcolor{red}{causally associated EDIT I don't like this phrase} with our outcome and also associated with the exposure in our sample.  \\

\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textit{Example:} suppose we're interested in the relationship between smoking and lung function in kids. We know that age is causally associated with lung function: as children grow and develop, their lung function improves. If age is also associated with smoking in our sample (e.g., if older kids are more likely to smoke), then age is a confounder.
\end{itemize} 

\vspace{0.3cm}

\small \textit{Much more on the topic of confounding to come...} 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Experimental studies}

\begin{frame}{Randomized controlled trial}
Description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Take a sample from the population and \textbf{randomly assign} individuals to either treatment (\textit{exposed}) or control/placebo (\textit{unexposed}), and follow individuals to observe a specific outcome (e.g., death yes/no, disease yes/no, time to death, change in cholesterol level, \dots)
\end{itemize}

Description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Take a sample from the population and \textbf{randomly assign} individuals to either treatment (\textit{exposed}) or control/placebo (\textit{unexposed}), and follow individuals to observe a specific outcome (e.g., death yes/no, disease yes/no, time to death, change in cholesterol level, \dots)
\end{itemize}
Pros:
\begin{itemize}
	\item With a large enough sample, no confounding
	\item Gold standard for establishing causality

	\item Gold standard for establishing causality
\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Often very expensive
	\item Not always possible or ethical to randomize individuals
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cannot randomly assign someone to a specific age, genetic variant, etc.
		\item Unethical to randomly assign harmful exposures (e.g., smoking)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Cohort study}
Description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample people \textit{without the outcome of interest}, record their exposure, then \textit{follow} those individuals over time to observe the outcome
	\item Can be \textit{prospective} (sample people in present time, then follow-up) or \textit{restrospective} (sample people from a database collected in the past, and observe them through their time recorded in the database)
\end{itemize}
Pros:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time sequence is known (exposure came first)
	\item Can study multiple outcomes 
\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Inefficient for rare outcomes
	\item Prospective cohort studies are often expensive and time-consuming to follow people, and there are opportunities for people to drop out
	\item Potential confounding (so no conclusions about causality)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Case-control study}
Description:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sample individuals \textit{based on the outcome} (some with, some without), look back in time (usually) for exposure

\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item May not know time sequence of disease and exposure

You read \href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2569059?resultClick=24}{\color{cyan} this article} (from 2017), interested in the association between androgen deprivation therpy (ADT), a treatment for prostate cancer, and risk of dementia (ADT). \\~\

From the article: \textit{In this... study, a text-processing method was used to analyze electronic medical record data from... 1994 to 2013. We identified 9455 individuals with prostate cancer who were 18 years or older at diagnosis with data recorded in the electronic health record and follow-up after diagnosis. We tested the effect of ADT on the risk of dementia.}

	\item What kind of study design is this?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[]  \color{cyan} Cohort study (retrospective)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Why do you think they chose this design? % cheap, can't randomly assign ADT
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[] \color{cyan} Randomized controlled trials are out of the question, since you can't randomly assign prostate cancer to individuals. This leaves observational studies. Dementia is not particularly rare, and they likely wanted to make statements about relative risks, so case-control studies are out as well. Cross-sectional studies wouldn't necessarily allow the researchers to determine if dementia came before or after ADT. It may also be difficult to ask individuals with dementia about their history with ADT. Cohort studies are cheap (especially retrospective), and also easily allow the researchers to know whether or not ADT came before dementia \textit{and} how long of a time there was between ADT and dementia, which may be of interest.

Suppose you are interested in determining whether or not there is an association between being a vegetarian and owning a pet iguana. \textit{Very few} individuals own iguanas. Which study design would be most appropriate for answering your research question, and why? 

\vspace{0.3cm}

\color{cyan} Case-control study. Since we are not interested in establishing causality (``being a vegetarian causes you to own an iguana"...), an observational study is appropriate. Since owning an iguana is rare, cohort studies and cross-sectional studies will likely be inefficient. Therefore, a case-control study is most appropriate.
